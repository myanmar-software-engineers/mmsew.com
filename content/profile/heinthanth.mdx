I do random, awesome stuffs and interested in low level programming, although I work as a Web Developer.

I'm Hein Thant Maung Maung ( /ˈheɪn ˈθənt məʊŋ məʊŋ/ ) or William.

Although I'm working as a Web Developer, I also experience in other fields such as Mobile Development, Linux Administration, etc.

I'm an Ahri main in League of Legends: Wild Rift. Sometimes, I make random music.<br />
